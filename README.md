# suspend-tab-extension

This is a simple chrome/edge extension that lets you freeze tabs! For me, I really like to have my tabs organized for future reference, but it breaks my heart to delete tabs for the sake of my computer's performance. So I wrote this extension that unloads a given tab so that I can keep my stuff organzised while being able to run my intensive R scripts and such.
